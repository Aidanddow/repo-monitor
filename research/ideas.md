## Ideas for Project Work

* Use GitHub/GitLab API instead of GitPython

* Add ability to merge multiple developers into one, i.e. Aidanddow and 2468915D are both me

* Use Git Diffs to produce metrics such as are spoken about in that paper

* Get project language makeup, then compare that with code each developer has written, i.e. Project is 50% python, 50% javascript. Aidanddow has written 90% Python, 10% Javascript.
